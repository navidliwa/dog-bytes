# Dog-Bytes

## Description

Dog-Bytes is a place to store and track your dog's information and generate diet recommendations for each pet. The idea for this came when one of the devs mentioned that remembering exactly how to split up food between wet and dry for her dogs was difficult, and that she wished she had an app for that.

The project was a great opportunity to get exposed to some of the tools available for freelance developers, such as the MaterializeCSS design library, as well as the various public APIs used. It also gave us a chance to practice using JQuery, especially to create loops and render elements from the DOM.

## Usage
